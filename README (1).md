# Spigot Exploit Patch

The "Paper Dupe" exploit allows players to duplicate items on Minecraft servers running Paper versions 1.20.6 to 1.21.1. It works by rapidly throwing items and sending a crafted book update packet, causing a server-side glitch. Server owners must prevent this to maintain economic balance, gameplay fairness, and overall server integrity.


## How Does The Plugin Work?

 - Monitors Player Actions:
 The plugin listens for specific packets related to inventory clicks and book editing.

 - Throttles Clicks:
It prevents players from clicking too quickly to avoid potential duplication exploits.

 - Enforces Book Editing Rules:

It ensures that book editing is only allowed when a writable book is in the playerâ€™s main hand.

 - Detects Suspicious Book Titles:

It cancels book edits with suspicious titles containing the word "exploit" and logs potential exploit attempts.
